# Pixel Manipulation with Canvas API

With the ImageData object we can directly read and write a data array to manipulate pixel data.

## Instructions

Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
npm i
```

Start live-server with following script.

```bash
npm start
```

The script above will compile `.ts` to `.js` and run the live-server on localhost on port `4000`.

You can change serving port within `server.js` configurations.

```js
const params = {
  port: 4000, // <- here
  host: "0.0.0.0",
  open: true,
  root: "src",
};
```

Thanks!
